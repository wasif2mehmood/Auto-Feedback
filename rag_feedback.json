    "feedback": "Your publication showcases a well-structured implementation of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, successfully highlighting the use of effective metrics for evaluating retrieval performance and a clear rationale for model and embedding selections. However, to enhance the clarity and completeness of your work, it is essential to provide explicit details on your text chunking strategy, including chunk size and overlap parameters, as well as more comprehensive documentation on document ingestion and processing. Addressing these gaps will significantly improve the overall robustness of your research.",
