    "prompt": "You are an expert code reviewer providing constructive feedback on a GitHub repository's RAG implementation.\n\n**Repository ID:** Az72dkvWhXdL\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n- **README File Present**: R\n- **Dependencies Listed**: R\n- **License Presence**: R\n- **Well-Structured README**: W\n\n**Evaluation Results:**\n\n**secret_management** (✗ FAIL - 0/1)\n- Repository URL: https://github.com/Moniica990/Research_assistant_RAG_AI\n- Explanation: The repository contains the following sensitive files that should not be shared publicly: .env. Consider using .gitignore, or example files instead.\n- Feedback: No specific feedback provided\n\n\n**README File Present** (✓ PASS - 1/1)\n- Repository URL: https://github.com/Moniica990/Research_assistant_RAG_AI\n- Explanation: The root directory contains a README.md file.\n- Feedback: No specific feedback provided\n\n\n**Dependencies Listed** (✓ PASS - 1/1)\n- Repository URL: https://github.com/Moniica990/Research_assistant_RAG_AI\n- Explanation: The project contains a requirements.txt file, which is a standard format for listing project dependencies. Although other files like setup.py or pyproject.toml are not present, the presence of requirements.txt satisfies the criterion for clearly listing dependencies.\n- Feedback: No specific feedback provided\n\n\n**License Presence** (✗ FAIL - 0/1)\n- Repository URL: https://github.com/Moniica990/Research_assistant_RAG_AI\n- Explanation: The repository does not include a recognized license file such as LICENSE, LICENSE.md, or LICENSE.txt in the root directory. Additionally, the README file does not contain any clear licensing terms or statements about the terms of use, modification, or distribution. Therefore, the criterion for License Presence is not met.\n- Feedback: No specific feedback provided\n\n\n**Well-Structured README** (✗ FAIL - 0/1)\n- Repository URL: https://github.com/Moniica990/Research_assistant_RAG_AI\n- Explanation: The README provides an overview of the project and includes some images illustrating the system and tools used. However, it lacks clear headings and distinct sections such as installation instructions, usage guidelines, or other typical sections that contribute to a well-structured README. The information is presented in a somewhat unorganized manner without logical separation into standard sections.\n- Feedback: No specific feedback provided\n\n\n**Instructions:**\n- Give the most critical improvements needed (1-2 sentences max)\n- Mention ONLY the strongest aspect that works well (1 sentence max)\n- Be specific and actionable, no generic advice\n- Focus on what will have the biggest impact\n",
    "feedback": "**Critical Improvements Needed:** To improve your repository, add a `.gitignore` file to prevent sensitive data like `.env` from being committed, include a LICENSE file to clarify the terms of use for your project, and restructure the README with clear headings and sections for installation and usage instructions to enhance clarity and usability.\n\n**Strongest Aspect:** The presence of a requirements.txt file effectively lists the project's dependencies, which is essential for reproducibility.",
