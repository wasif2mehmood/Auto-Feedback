    "feedback": "The publication would benefit greatly from including detailed information on memory mechanisms and reasoning capabilities, as well as implementing safety measures and guardrails to ensure the responsible use of the RAG assistant. These aspects are critical for enhancing user trust and ensuring the system's reliability. On a positive note, the clarity in outlining the RAG architecture and the rationale behind chosen components, such as the use of FAISS and OpenAI's embedding model, is particularly strong and demonstrates a solid understanding of the technical requirements.",
